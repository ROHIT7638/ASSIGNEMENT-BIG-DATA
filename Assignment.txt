## Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?


ANS    Because it is is very similar to english language and it is easily understable  thats why we called as a high level proraamming language .



Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?


ANS   It is dynamically typed language because there is no need to declare the kind of variable it state the kind of variable during the runtime .

 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?


ANS    PROS     
            1. Easily understable and readable  
            2. it has extensive libraries
            3. it is an interpreted language 

       CONS
            1. IT is slower compare to other language 
            2. it consume more space
            3. it is not secure than other language

  
             
Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?


ANS  1. web devlopment
     2. artificial intelligence and machine learning 
     3. gaming devlopment
     4. data science 
     5. data visualization
     6. software devlopment 


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?


ANS   Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object.
      
      we can declare variable in python
       
    1.  Just name the variable.

    2.  Assign the required value to it.
  

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?


ANS  WE can throw input function in python by using input function i.e  = Input("Enter username") .



Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?


ANS  By default, input returns a string. So the name and age will be stored as strings = 'str'.


Q8. What is type casting?


ANS The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting.
 
     EXAMPLE= int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(), set(), list(), dict() etc. 


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?


ANS   " yes" we can take more than one input from the user using single input() function .

        like this   " x = list(map(int, input("Enter multiple values: "). split())) " 



Q10. What are keywords?


ANS In Python, there are approximately around thirty-three (33) keywords, 

       and a few of the keywords generally used in the program coding are

         like " break, continue, true, if, else, elif, import, from, except, exec, print, return, yield, lambda, global," etc.

 

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

ANS  We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. Except True , False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as they are.
     
     REASON :- Keyword are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.



Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

ANS Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
     Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only,
      the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.



Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?


ANS  WE can throw output function in python by using print function i.e "print()"


Q14. What are operators in Python?


ANS  operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.
      The values that an operator acts on are called operands. 
        Here is an example: >>> >>> a = 10 >>> b = 20 >>> a + b 30.



Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?


ANS  These operators are mathematical operators and both have different uses.
      " / " Only perform the division operation in mathematics and returns results as the quotient,
         while " // " is known as modulus. ... / divides and returns the answer.



Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.

```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron


ANS   print("'''")

      print(input("iNeuron"*4))#iNeuron

     OUTPUT
           '''
           iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron



Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

ANS  num = int(input("Enter any number: "))
     flag = num%2

     if flag == 0:

        print(num, "is an even number")

     elif flag == 1:

     print(num, "is an odd number")

   OUTPUT 
      1.   Enter any number: 22
            22 is an even number

      2.  Enter any number: 13
            13 is an odd number 


Q18. What are boolean operator?


ANS Boolean Operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) 
     used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search.



Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

ANS  1, 0, false,1


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?


ANS  We have different types of conditional statements like 
      if, if-else, elif, nested if, and nested if-else statements 
        which control the execution of our program.


Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?


Ans  'if'… 'elif'…'else' are conditional statements that provide 
       you with the decision making that is required 
        when you want to execute code based on a particular condition. 


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

        if age >= 18:

         print("I can vote")

        else :

         print("I can't vote")

     elif (num2 > num1 and num2> num3):

         print ("The Largest number is", num2)

     else:
         print ("The Largest number is", num3)
